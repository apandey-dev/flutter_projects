# 🚀 Flutter Projects

A daily Flutter practice repository where I build and upload UI/UX focused projects, small feature implementations, and layout experiments to continuously improve my Flutter development skills.

This repository is mainly focused on:

* 🎨 UI/UX design implementation
* 📱 Authentication screens (Login, Signup, Forgot Password)
* 🧾 Form handling & validation
* 🔁 Navigation using Navigator
* 🏗 Clean layout structuring
* 📦 Reusable widget patterns
* 📚 Learning by building daily

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Most projects follow a structure like:

```
lib/
 ├── main.dart
 ├── login_card.dart
 ├── signup_card.dart
 ├── forget_password.dart
```

Each project demonstrates proper screen separation and navigation between pages.
